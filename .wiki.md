# Project Summary
The Expense Management System is a web application aimed at simplifying expense tracking for organizations. It includes features such as user authentication, expense submission, and tracking history. Built using modern web technologies like HTML, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript, the application leverages Supabase for backend services, integrates with the ExchangeRate API for currency conversions, and utilizes an OCR microservice for receipt processing.

# Project Module Description
- **Authentication Module**: Handles user signup and login via Supabase.
- **Expense Submission Module**: Enables users to submit expenses with details including amount, currency, category, description, and receipt uploads.
- **Expense History Module**: Presents a history of submitted expenses with filtering options.
- **API Integration Module**: Manages external API calls for country data, exchange rates, and receipt processing.
- **Error Handling Module**: Implements error handling across the application to improve user experience.
